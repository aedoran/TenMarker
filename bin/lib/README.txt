The various .jar files in this directory are provided so that you can build
all the FreeMarker source code. They are all copyright by their respective
copyright holders and available under the license under which they are 
made available. For the moment, use google to find out these licensing 
terms. [Note: Consider the last sentences a stub. we should eventually
include the copyright/license stuff here.]

The cavalry.jar file is a slightly special, since it contains a patched 
version of Velocity that can be used to convert from Velocity to FreeMarker 
syntax. It is included here as a dependency instead of the avalon logkit jar. 
It contains the logkit classes since that is a Velocity dependency.
